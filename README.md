# TEXchange: A Decentralized Online Textbook Marketplace

### TEXchange is a cross platform web application created with the intention of decentralizing the college textbook market. It is designed so that users will be able to autonomously sell used textbooks at a price of their choosing. TEXchange will enable users to actively compete with more traditional services such as campus bookstores and online vendors. Each user will have a profile specifying which school they attend, what textbooks they are selling or buying, as well as a history of textbooks they have traded on the site. A user can search available textbooks by entering the ISBN, title, or author’s name of the textbook. TEXchange will then return all the books being sold by peers at the user’s school. TEXchange is implemented with modularity and ease of access so that it may be effectively deployed on any college or university campus.
